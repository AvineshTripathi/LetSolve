# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

-------------------------------------
# Introduction
1. The Website is developed for a citizen Grievance Redressal System in an informal manner.
2.  But in formal sense a website is to be developed which will control the grievance redressal system online. 
3.	The function of the website cell is to look into the complaints raised by any citizen and judge its merit. 
4.	The Grievance cell is also empowered to look into matters of harassment. Anyone with a genuine grievance can register and submit their complaint which will be approached by the department members in consultation with the officer in-charge of Grievance Cell. 
5.	Citizens can register their complaints and grievances online.

# Objectives:
1.	To make complaints easier to coordinate, monitor, track and resolve the Grievances. 
2.	To provide an effective tool to identify and target problem areas and find solutions.
3.	Prompt and specific retrieval of data.
4.	Controlling redundancy in storing the same data multiple times.
5.	Accuracy, timeliness and comprehensiveness of the system output. 
6.	Enhancement in the completion of work within the constraints of time. 

# Outcomes:
1.	To solve Grievances that has been submitted through the application which has been issued by the users in the most efficient way possible.
2.	To ensure transparency in institutions imparting technical education, with the supreme objective of preventing unfair practices and to provide a mechanism to students, parents, teachers and other non-teaching staff for the redressal of their complaints.
